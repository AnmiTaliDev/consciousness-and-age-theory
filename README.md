# Theory of Awareness and Age

A staged model of consciousness and self-awareness development in neurotypical people, considering gender differences.

## Description

This theory describes the development of human consciousness from early childhood to full adulthood, highlighting key stages in the formation of self-awareness, memory, empathy, and critical thinking. The theory is based on observations and analysis of neurotypical development, taking into account gender-specific maturation features.

## Core Concepts

- **"Autopilot"** – the mode of minimal awareness at early age  
- **Gradual "autopilot shutdown"** – transition to conscious thinking  
- **Gender differences** in development pace and characteristics  
- **Formation of the "self"** – stages of self-awareness development  

## Development Stages

### General stages (0–9 years)
- **0–3 years**: No self-awareness, minimal skills  
- **3.5 years**: Emergence of self-awareness, memory and analysis kick in, empathy appears  
- **3.5–5 years**: New skills, memory of vivid events, intuition starts  
- **5–7 years**: Start of socialization, autopilot shutting down, sympathy  
- **7–9 years**: Enhanced understanding of one’s feelings and emotions  

### Girls-women (9–30+ years)
- **9–10 years**: Start of puberty  
- **11–13 years**: Transition period, beginning of adult awareness  
- **13–16 years**: Psycho-hormonal changes, personality generation and “grown-up” effect  
- **16–19 years**: “Adult” thinking mode  
- **19–30+ years**: Final preparation for full adulthood  

### Boys-men (9–30+ years)
- **9 years**: Relatively calm period  
- **10–13 years**: Start of puberty  
- **13–16 years**: Full set of teenage skills  
- **16–18 years**: Psycho-hormonal changes, awareness of social norms  
- **18–25 years**: Rapid catching-up with girls in maturation level  
- **25–30+ years**: Full adulthood  

## Key Features

1. **Individual differences**: The given age ranges are averages, actual timing may vary  
2. **Neurotypicality**: The theory applies to people without neurodevelopmental traits  
3. **Cultural factors**: Development may vary depending on cultural context  
4. **Gender specificity**: Biological and social differences in development are considered  

## Scientific Basis

The theory relies on:
- Studies on prefrontal cortex development  
- Data on formation of self-awareness and episodic memory  
- Research on gender differences in brain maturation  
- Concepts of critical thinking and metacognitive processes  
- Teenager analysis  
- Idk what else. Just sat down and came up with it  

## Application

The theory may be useful for:
- Understanding age-specific development features  
- Educational programs  
- Work with children and adolescents  
- Research in developmental psychology
